# Intro
Sensi is an intelligent system that is able to use its senses to perceive and interact with the world around it.
Sensi can receive instructions to do tasks but it might do something else(!)
Becuase Sensi needs to verify if the provided instruction is even possible. Or maybe something else is better than the provided instruction.

# How Sensi Works
Sensi starts by sensing, which is reading (in future, seeing and listening)
But how can a bot see the world through reading?
What is something that can translate a text into a model? Embedding?

imagineing how something works, hypothesize, 

How much give wight to memory, how much to new data? a good start is to keep it like ax+b , and b as the bias from memory.


to solve arc agi maybe it needs to learn rotation, colors, etc.. what skills does it need to learn?

then it comes the "Ask"

when you want to turn something into a model/analogy/simplify-it it must have certian qualities. in humans it happens a lot that we try to use a model in a wrong setting. so not just model building is important but how good you are in re-use or build is important. so models must have something to them that once you look at them, either you feel you need a new one or you can use them. 

# Future
when we succussfully built a intelligent system  that can learn the skills and apply them, how it can become a sicentist?
how it can achieve to create something like markov chains?

For hard problems, you need a clear mind and pure intention to solve them.
