# Intro
Sensi is an intelligent system that is able to use its senses to perceive and interact with the world around it.
Sensi can receive instructions to do tasks but it might do something else(!)
Becuase Sensi needs to verify if the provided instruction is even possible. Or maybe something else is better than the provided instruction.

# Intuition 
Sensi starts by sensing, which is reading (in future, seeing and listening)
But how can a bot see the world through reading?
What is something that can translate a text into a model? Embedding?
This is important because seeing/modeling is the solution.

So the question is what is the closest compressed model to what I'm seeing. yes

Imagineing how something works, hypothesizing, playing, trying, -> but most importantly seeing 

How much wight we should give to memory, how much to new data? like ax+b, and b as the bias from memory.


To solve arc agi maybe it needs to learn rotation, colors, etc.. what skills does it need to learn?

then it comes the "Ask"

When you want to turn something into a model/analogy/simplify-it it must have certian qualities. in humans it happens a lot that we try to use a model in a wrong setting. 
So not just model building is important but how good you are in re-use or build is important. 
So models must have a quality to them that once you look at them, either you feel you need a new one or you can use them. 

How about a unified design that is happening in sensing through acting. like a turing machine.


So the question is what is the closest compressed model to what I'm seeing. yes

now, what is a model?
you do i1,i2,i3,i4 ... you get o1,o2,o3, o4, ...

you can compose models

a simple task is one models
a complex task is multiple models
how a smart person can quickly search if there's a path with learned things to a model?


# How Sensi works
1. learn to build a model
2. treat things with your learned models
3. you can compose models , which builds new models

100. intenisify applied models and forget loose models

# Goal
Implement and test against ARC-AGI

# Future
- when we succussfully built a intelligent system  that can learn the skills and apply them, how it can become a sicentist?
how it can achieve to create something like markov chains?

- Sensing can be also seeing and listenting

- For hard problems, you need a clear mind and pure intention to solve them.
