Dominant Differential Equation Models in Keenan Crane’s Research
Elliptic PDEs (Laplace and Poisson Equations)
One of the most central classes of equations in Crane’s work are elliptic partial differential equations, especially the Laplace and Poisson equations. Many of his geometry processing algorithms ultimately reduce to solving a Poisson equation on a surface. In fact, Crane notes that “most of these applications boil down to solving a sparse Poisson equation”[1] – a prototypical example being harmonic interpolation of boundary data (solving Laplace’s equation for a harmonic function that smoothly fills in a region)[1]. Harmonic functions (solutions of Laplace’s equation) thus appear throughout his research as fundamental tools for interpolation, parameterization, and shape reconstruction[2].
•	Laplace/Poisson Equations in Practice: Many tasks in Crane’s papers involve solving Laplace or Poisson equations on meshes. For example, computing smooth scalar fields for surface parameterization or deformation often entails solving a Poisson equation with appropriate boundary conditions. Designing smooth direction fields or vector fields on surfaces can likewise boil down to a Poisson solve; Crane’s method for globally optimal direction fields achieves the smoothest field by minimizing a quadratic energy, and when a guidance field is provided, “finding the optimal field amounts to solving a single linear Poisson problem”[3]. Similarly, winding number computations on surfaces use a “standard Poisson equation” as the main step[4][5], and even the fast geodesic algorithms ultimately involve Poisson solves (as discussed below). Overall, the sparse linear system corresponding to the Laplace–Beltrami operator is a workhorse in Crane’s research.
•	Monte Carlo Solvers for Elliptic PDEs: In recent work, Crane has also focused on grid-free Monte Carlo methods for elliptic PDEs. These algorithms (e.g. Walk on Spheres/Stars) directly target fundamental elliptic equations like Laplace’s equation without traditional meshing[6]. For instance, the Walk on Stars method “solves linear elliptic PDEs with arbitrary mixed Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions”[7] – meaning it can handle Laplace or Poisson boundary value problems with Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin conditions on complex domains[8]. This further underlines that Laplace/Poisson models are conceptually central: Crane and collaborators develop novel solvers to handle them efficiently in difficult geometric settings[9][8].
Parabolic PDEs (Heat Diffusion Processes)
Another frequently used model is parabolic PDEs, especially the heat equation (diffusion equation). Crane leverages heat diffusion both as a tool for shape analysis and as a building block for algorithms. A prime example is the Heat Method for geodesic distance computation: instead of solving the nonlinear hyperbolic eikonal equation directly, the method uses a short-time heat diffusion followed by a Poisson solve to recover distances[10]. In practice, one performs a brief heat flow on the surface (simulating heat diffusing from a source), then normalizes the temperature gradient and solves a Poisson equation so that its gradient aligns with that direction field – yielding the geodesic distance solution[10]. This approach transforms a difficult non-linear problem into two linear PDE solves; as Crane’s course notes highlight, “the shortest distance along the surface can be rapidly computed by solving two standard sparse linear equations”[11] (an implicit heat diffusion step and a Laplace solve).
Heat diffusion also appears in other contexts. For example, Crane’s Vector Heat Method extends the same principle to vector data: it computes parallel transport of tangent vectors by “a short-time heat flow involving the connection Laplacian,” so that transporting a vector field is achieved via solving a small number of linear systems (each akin to a Poisson problem)[10]. The DiffusionNet architecture likewise uses a diffusion layer on surfaces (essentially repeatedly applying a heat operator) to let features spread across a mesh in a way that is independent of mesh resolution[12]. In summary, heat-type PDEs are a recurring theme – whenever a problem involves smoothing, spreading information, or computing distances on a shape, Crane often introduces a heat diffusion step. These parabolic models provide robust, stable approaches to tasks that might otherwise require more complicated or unstable formulations.
Curvature Flows (Surface Fairing and Evolution)
Curvature flow models – which are also typically parabolic PDEs, but often nonlinear – play a notable role in Crane’s work on surface optimization and fairing. In particular, Crane has worked on flows that smooth or evolve surfaces according to curvature. A highlight is his formulation of Willmore flow (a fourth-order curvature flow that reduces bending energy) for triangulated surfaces. In the paper “Robust Fairing via Conformal Curvature Flow,” Crane (with Pinkall and Schröder) developed a highly stable version of discrete Willmore flow[13]. By expressing the flow in curvature space and enforcing certain constraints, they achieved an algorithm that can take extraordinarily large time steps without destroying mesh quality[13]. This curvature-based PDE allowed them to fair surfaces (smooth out noise and roughness) while naturally preserving details like texture and without needing remeshing during the flow[13]. The same work also produced a length-preserving curvature flow for planar curves as an analogy[14].
Crane’s research and teaching emphasize other geometric flows as well. For instance, mean curvature flow (where each surface point moves in the normal direction at a speed equal to mean curvature) is treated as a fundamental smoothing mechanism in geometry processing. In one project on mesh simplification, he demonstrates that after converting a mesh to an intrinsic Delaunay form, one can reliably perform tasks like “mean curvature flow” on even very coarse meshes[15]. Likewise, in the context of conformal geometry, Crane’s notes discuss discrete Yamabe flow, a curvature flow that adjusts a mesh’s discrete metric to achieve uniform curvature (analogous to Ricci flow on surfaces)[16]. Across these examples, curvature-driven PDEs (mean curvature flow, Willmore flow, Yamabe flow) appear as conceptual pillars for shape smoothing, fairing, and uniformization. They repeatedly serve as foundational models when optimizing shapes or curvature distributions in Crane’s work[13][15].
Variational Problems and Euler–Lagrange Equations
Many problems in Crane’s portfolio are formulated as variational problems, which lead to differential equations (often elliptic) as their Euler–Lagrange conditions. Rather than directly stating a PDE, Crane often defines an energy functional that a solution should minimize – solving the problem then involves finding a function or shape that satisfies an optimality condition (i.e. a differential equation). For example, in designing tangent direction fields on surfaces, Crane et al. introduce a “simple quadratic energy” whose minimizer yields the smoothest possible N-direction field[17]. The solution is found by solving a sparse eigenvalue problem related to the cotangent Laplacian, and if alignment to a guidance field is required, it reduces further to “solving a single linear Poisson problem”[18]. Here the Euler–Lagrange equation of the quadratic energy is essentially a Poisson equation, illustrating how a variational principle leads to an elliptic PDE in practice.
Crane’s work on surface segmentation and parameterization also leverages variational flows. In “Variational Surface Cutting,” a global flow is formulated to cut surfaces for flattening with minimal distortion. Rather than evaluate cut quality in ad-hoc ways, they “formulate a flow that directly optimizes the distortion induced by cutting and flattening”[19]. Notably, this evolution equation is derived via shape derivatives of the Yamabe equation – the Yamabe equation is an elliptic PDE prescribing curvature via a conformal factor, and its shape derivative yields a curve evolution law that the authors integrate on the cut curve[19]. By numerically evolving the cut according to this PDE (an Eulerian curve flow), they achieve significantly lower flattening distortion[19].
Another example is the developable surface design problem. In “Developability of Triangle Meshes,” Crane and colleagues define an energy measuring how far a mesh deviates from developability (flattenability), then perform gradient descent on this energy to push the mesh toward developable pieces[20]. This gradient flow is effectively a variational PDE on the mesh geometry: at each iteration the vertex positions are updated in the direction that reduces the energy, analogous to an implicit time integration of the Euler–Lagrange equations of the developability energy. Numerous other tasks – from finding equilibrium shapes (e.g. resting rigid body orientations) to arranging shapes with Minkowski-based penalties – are tackled by setting up an energy and solving for its minimum, often using gradients or partial derivatives with respect to shape parameters. In summary, variational formulations are a dominant theme, and they typically lead to elliptic PDEs or gradient flows that are solved either directly or iteratively (via descent) in Crane’s projects[18][19].
Discrete Differential Geometry Analogs
A hallmark of Keenan Crane’s research is the use of discrete differential geometry to translate continuous differential equations into algebraic problems on meshes. He frequently works with discrete analogs of the classical differential operators and PDEs, ensuring that algorithms are both physically faithful and computationally tractable. For instance, a fundamental tool is the discrete Laplace–Beltrami operator (often in the form of the cotangent Laplacian matrix). Crane has even developed improved discrete Laplacians for difficult meshes – e.g. constructing a “tufted cover” so that even nonmanifold or high-valence meshes can be given a valid cotan-Laplacian with all nonnegative weights[21]. This robust Laplace operator then underpins tasks like geodesic distance computation, surface deformation, parameterization, and even minimal surface solving on those meshes[21][22]. The message is that having a good discrete Laplacian is crucial, since so many problems are solved by Laplace or Poisson equations in discrete form.
More broadly, Crane’s discrete differential geometry (DDG) approach uses structures like Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC) to unify various algorithms. In his SIGGRAPH course, he demonstrated that “a surprisingly wide variety of geometry processing tasks can be easily implemented within the single unified framework of discrete exterior calculus”[23]. Within this framework, computing things like conformal parameterizations, smoothing flows, geodesic distances, and vector field design all become solving linear systems that mirror the continuum PDEs[23][1]. For example, the DEC framework provides discrete versions of divergence, gradient, and Laplace operators so that solving a Poisson equation on a mesh is as straightforward as solving a sparse linear system. Indeed, Crane emphasizes that many applications boil down to a sparse Poisson solve[1], and using DEC one can set up that solve in a principled way. Even more exotic differential operators have their discrete counterparts in his work – for instance, Crane introduced a quaternionic discrete Dirac operator to handle conformal deformations in 3D, leading to a “sparse linear system” that enforces an integrability condition for discrete conformal maps[24]. All of these examples underscore that discrete analogs of PDEs are a cornerstone of his research: rather than solve PDEs on continuous surfaces directly, Crane formulates equivalent problems on meshes, solving them with linear algebra and combinatorial topology tools. This DDG paradigm ensures the algorithms are efficient, robust, and compatible with real-world geometric data[23][21].
Hyperbolic PDEs (Rarely Employed)
In contrast to the heavy use of elliptic and parabolic models, hyperbolic PDEs (such as wave equations or the eikonal equation) are not prominent in Crane’s publications. Problems that might classically be approached with hyperbolic equations are often tackled via alternative means. A good example is geodesic distance computation: the eikonal equation (a hyperbolic PDE) gives distance but is challenging to solve on complicated surfaces, so Crane’s heat method replaces it with a heat diffusion + Poisson approach[10] – effectively trading the hyperbolic model for a combination of parabolic and elliptic steps. Likewise, there is no emphasis on wave propagation or dynamic oscillatory PDEs in his work; most applications involve either steady-state solutions or diffusive processes rather than true wave dynamics. This reflects the nature of geometry processing tasks, which seldom require solving a time-dependent wave equation. Thus, elliptic (Laplace/Poisson) and parabolic (diffusive or curvature flow) equations dominate Crane’s research, while hyperbolic equations appear only indirectly, if at all. In summary, the conceptual center of his work lies with elliptic PDEs (for equilibrium and interpolation problems) and variational or parabolic flows (for smoothing and shape optimization), often implemented through discrete differential geometry representations[1][13].
Sources: Keenan Crane’s publications and course materials, which explicitly highlight the widespread use of Poisson (Laplace) equations in geometry processing[1][2], the use of heat diffusion for distances and vector field transport[10], the development of curvature flows like Willmore flow for surface fairing[13], numerous variational formulations leading to PDEs[18][19], and the discrete differential geometry framework enabling these models on meshes[23][21]. These recurring differential equation models – elliptic (Laplace/Poisson), parabolic (heat and curvature flows), and variational (Euler–Lagrange) – are the most dominant across Crane’s body of work, forming the backbone of his geometric algorithms.
